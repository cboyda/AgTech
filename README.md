### Agri-Forward Pitch Deck 🐔
- ‘Autonomously Improving Livestock Environments’
- Currently producers are generalizing their data barely able to collect averages of their flocks.  What if we could collect individual animal details? Customizing male chicken diets has showed a 5% increase in fertility.  Imagine those results on your whole flock?
- ***Team Aeris*** is focused on improving livestock environments by collecting individual animal statistics, environmental sensor data and optimizing their environment for the healthiest outcome.  Healthier Livestock means a Healthier Society!
